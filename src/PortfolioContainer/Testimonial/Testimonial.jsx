He helped me with trouble shooting an issues in the product and he has gained sound knowledge in the product. He also inherits analytical skills for trouble shooting. He was to shadowing product team lead when he was absence and took the full responsibility in all tasks and did a marvelous job. He is a superb team player and maintains a healthy relationship among team members. He always tries to help others in the team and others value his contribution.He is technically sound in Front End technologies. I have conducted few code review sessions with him and shows excellent coding styles and maintains clean code. He is a quick learner as well when adopting to new technologies.
